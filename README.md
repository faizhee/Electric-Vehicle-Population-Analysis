# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Electric Vehicle Population Data to understand trends in electric vehicle adoption, popular manufacturers, and vehicle types.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Analysis Performed
- Analysis of electric vehicle adoption over the years
- Identification of top electric vehicle manufacturers
- Comparison of electric vehicle types (BEV vs PHEV)
- Visualization of trends using charts

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Electric Vehicle Population Data.
Due to GitHub’s file size limitation (25MB), the dataset is not uploaded to this repository.
The dataset was provided as part of the internship assignment.
